EQ Labs' approach is designed to address the systemic issues of workplace discrimination. This means we're working to reverse unconscious bias, combat conscious bias, and mitigate the impacts of both - in the daily interactions of managers with their teams.

- Mix of Training, Daily Priming, and Tools
  - Training sets the stage and addresses motivations and appropriate framing (prejudice as habit)
  - Daily priming provides "prejudice hygiene" like teethbrushing (counter-stereotype and behaviour modeling)
  - Tools mitigate the most pernicious impacts of unchecked bias ( during task assignment, meetings, credit taking, 1:1s and performance reviews)
- Built into the tools that managers use most (Gmail, Slack and Zoom)
