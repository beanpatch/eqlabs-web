A 1% bias in performance reviews results in just 35% of top positions being held by the under-represented group. Management training, on average, starts 12 years after first promotion to management. That’s 12 years of invisible bias destroying any pipeline improvements you make.

Aside from being the right thing to do, mitigating bias will positively impact your performance as an organization. Gender and ethnic diversity on executive teams is strongly correlated with profitability and value creation. Top-quartile diversity executive teams were 21% more likely to outperform others on profitability, and 27% more likely to have superior value creation. [(Delivering through Diversity, McKinsey, 2019)][1]

## It’s not an information problem.
## It's a *habit* problem.

Out of over 400 research studies of Unconscious Bias Training, we could only find [one intervention][1] that was scientifically proven to both impact unconscious bias measurements, and also change human behaviour. Now we can help you apply this to the moments that impact every employee's career, every day. It relies on framing prejudice as a _habit_ to be broken, and has been adapted to apply to both gender and racial bias. More importantly, it's been shown to have long-term impacts.

Our products combine science, software, and behavioural design to break the ‘bias habit’. We use a mix of: Education approaches focused on creating awareness and introducing strategies; ‘Nudge’ tools integrated with common management productivity software to shift career-impacting moments; ‘Boosts’ through subscription content that continually reinforces this new perspective.
