Out of over 400 research studies of Unconscious Bias Training, we could only find [one intervention][1] that was scientifically proven to both impact unconscious bias measurements, and also change human behaviour. Now we're working to prove that this can change the workplace.

It relies on framing prejudice as a _habit_ to be broken, and has been adapted to apply to both gender and racial bias. More importantly, it's been shown to have long-term impact. 

But a one-time intervention is not enough. We're also drawing from research on [retraining how we *see* (literally) our colleagues.][2]

And, we're talking a scientific approach to our systemic interventions, as well - rather than letting managers make critical decisions when they're cognitively loaded (when their unconscious biases will have the maximum impact), we're providing a structured framework for the most high-impact management activities. We intervene during Task Assignment, [Meetings][3], [Hiring][4], Performance Reviews and more.
