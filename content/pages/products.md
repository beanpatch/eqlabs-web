        <p>It matches words, phrases, even parts-of-speech, and is focused on helping users understand the <b>why</b> behind every suggestion.</p>

        <p class="tertiary-title">Daily Heroes Browser Extension</p>
        <p>We need to actively work to replace stereotypes, rather than just trying to be ‘more objective’, and research has shown that facial-recognition processing is central to establishing and maintaining these stereotypes.
Each time a new tab or window is opened, the EQ Daily Heros chrome extension displays a different “daily hero”, along with a short description of their achievement.</p>
<p>Will using it prompt you to open tons of new tabs just to see more heros? Our anecdata say yes. Do we think that’s amazing? We absolutely do.</p>
