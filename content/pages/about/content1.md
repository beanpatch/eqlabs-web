# Workplace Discrimination: It's A Wicked Hard Problem

Everything about prejudice in the workplace fits [the definition of a "Wicked  Problem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem).

We realize and embrace the fact that the angle and facet of the problem that we focus on / align towards, will define both the possible impacts as well as the interested parties. In this fashion, we have embraced the “manager as change agent” point of leverage.

We are consciously attempting to make things “somewhat better”. Alternative approaches (which we honor without embracing) include working to deconstruct the current systems, to focus on reparations, or to strive for general education and awareness.

This is a “social entrepreneurship” effort. We intend to create positive financial outcomes for our staff and investors, and we embrace thoughtful selection of both groups. Alternative approaches (which we honor without embracing) include strictly not-for-profit efforts, worker-owned cooperatives without outside investment, or policy and legislative work within existing government structures.

Possible risks of our approach include, most crucially, the risk that our interventions make things worse or that they accomplish nothing, but take the place of more meaningful or impactful inclusion efforts. (See [Sara Ahmed’s talk on the "Uses of Use"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avKJ2w1mhng).) A lesser risk is that we accomplish modest change in some areas, but overall take resources (especially attention) away from more transformational efforts.

Given the nature of a wicked problem, this effort will likely have enormous impacts (positive and/or negative) on the reputation of the staff.
