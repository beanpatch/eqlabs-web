EQ Labs' approach is designed to address the systemic issues of workplace discrimination. This means we're working to reverse unconscious bias, combat conscious bias, and mitigate the impacts of both - in the daily interactions of managers with their teams.

 * Mix of Training, Daily Priming, and Tools
  - Training sets the stage and addresses motivations and appropriate framing (prejudice as habit)
  - Daily priming provides "prejudice hygiene" like teethbrushing (counter-stereotype and behaviour modeling)
  - Tools mitigate the most pernicious impacts of unchecked bias ( during task assignment, meetings, credit taking, 1:1s and performance reviews)
* Built into the tools that managers use most (Gmail, Slack and Zoom)

# Next Steps

We are now accepting a limited number of pilot engagements. Participating organizations should commit to a minimum of three managers, who will go through a half-day training process and then engage with EQ software on a daily basis. Supervision will be provided by neuroscience and social development researchers in partnership with the University of Victoria. If you would be interested in having your organization engage in a 3-month, validated Action Research program, please contact discovery@eqlabs.io.
