The bad news is that unconscious bias in daily interactions add up, and undermine formal processes for diversity and inclusion in hiring, talent identification, and promotion.
The good news is that these everyday behaviours can be changed without radically reshaping anyone's internal landscape.

* We are focused on working with managers (rather than the overall team).
* We care about the career-impacting interactions (especially around task assignment, credit taking and promotions)
* We intervene in the moments where managers and team members are interacting every day (meetings, chat and emails)

Much like Duolingo or Headspace, our tools alternate between short micro-learning lessons, and practices within a set of self-guided strategies. But unlike learning a language, the practices focus on activities that happen in the real world.

# Next Steps

We are now accepting a limited number of pilot engagements. Participating organizations should commit to a minimum of three managers, who will go through a half-day training process and then engage with EQ software on a daily basis. Supervision will be provided by neuroscience and social development researchers in partnership with local universities. If you would be interested in having your organization engage in a 3-month, validated Action Research program, please [contact us](/contact).
