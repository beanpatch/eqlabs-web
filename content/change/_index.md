EQ Labs' approach is designed to address the systemic issues of workplace discrimination. This means we're working to reverse unconscious bias, combat conscious bias, and mitigate the impacts of both - in the daily interactions of managers with their teams.

We approach this with a unique mix of training, daily content, and software tools.

The training course (a half-day, in-person interactive session for independently motivated people managers at all levels) sets the stage and establishes the appropriate framing (prejudice as habit). We also provide a set of strategies for your staff to use in their ongoing work.

Daily priming provides ongoing "prejudice hygiene." Similar to toothbrushing, continued exposure to counter-stereotype content helps to mitigate unconscious bias.

The most critical aspect of our interventions are a set of software tools. These mitigate the most pernicious impacts of unchecked bias, by providing equitable defaults and accountability during task assignment, meetings, credit taking, 1:1s and performance reviews. They are built into the tools that managers use most (Gmail, Outlook, Slack, Teams and Zoom).

# Next Steps

We are now accepting a limited number of pilot engagements. Participating organizations should commit to a minimum of three managers, who will go through a half-day training process and then engage with EQ software on a daily basis. Supervision will be provided by neuroscience and social development researchers in partnership with local universities. If you would be interested in having your organization engage in a 3-month, validated Action Research program, please [contact us](/contact).
