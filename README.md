# EQ Labs: Workplace Equity through Continuous Intervention

We reduce workplace discrimination by improving manager attitudes and behaviour through science-based continuous intervention. This improves employee retention, engagement and psychological safety.

During our discovery interview phase, in conversations with people across a variety of gender and race backgrounds, and at different stages of their careers, one theme was universal: Great managers made all the difference, and Bad Managers were, literally, the worst.

# Key Product Features:

EQ Labs' approach is designed to address the *systemic* issues of workplace discrimination. This means we're working to reverse unconscious bias, combat *conscious* bias, and mitigate the impacts of *both* - in the daily interactions of managers with their teams.

- Mix of Training, Daily Priming, and Tools
  - Training sets the stage and addresses motivations and appropriate framing (prejudice as habit)
  - Daily priming provides "prejudice hygiene" like teethbrushing (counter-stereotype and behaviour modeling)
  - Tools mitigate the most pernicious impacts of unchecked bias ( during task assignment, meetings, credit taking, 1:1s and performance reviews)

- Built into the tools that managers use most (Gmail, Slack and Zoom)

# Key Science:

Out of [over 400 studies][5] of Unconscious Bias Training, we could only find [one intervention][1] that was scientifically proven to both impact unconscious bias measurements, and also change human behaviour and outcomes. Best part? This was demonstrated to have a LASTING IMPACT - across years - and has been adapted to work on both gender and racial bias. 

But a one-time intervention is not enough. We're also drawing from research on [retraining how we *see* (literally) our colleagues.][2]

And, we're talking a scientific approach to our systemic interventions, as well - rather than letting managers make critical decisions when they're cognitively loaded (when their unconscious biases will have the maximum impact), we're providing a structured framework for the most high-impact management activities.

# Next Steps

We are now accepting a limited number of pilot engagements. Participating organizations should commit to a minimum of three managers, who will go through a half-day training process and then engage with EQ software on a daily basis. Supervision will be provided by neuroscience and social development researchers in partnership with the University of Victoria. If you would be interested in having your organization engage in a 3-month, validated Action Research program, please contact discovery@eqlabs.io.
